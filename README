Objectives
* Laterally compatible with GPL git. You should be able to symlink git to
  ogit and no one should be the wiser.
* Code clarity (not the case at the moment)
* BSD-2-Clause licensed

At the moment, the objective is a read-only version, akin to svnlite, but
there is some overlap in writing objects and updating the index.
